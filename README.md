# 🌟 Day 8 – Java Practice Tasks

Today’s focus was on:
- Using **HashMap** to count character frequency
- Practicing **Array Rotations** (Left and Right)
- Strengthening loops and logic building

---

## ✅ Programs Completed:

### 🔹 1. Character Frequency Counter  
📁 File: [CharacterFrequency.java](./CharacterFrequency.java)  
🧠 Used LinkedHashMap and `getOrDefault()` to count character occurrences.

---

### 🔹 2. Array Right Rotation  
📁 File: [ArrayRightRotation.java](./ArrayRightRotation.java)  
🔄 Right rotate an array `k` times using nested loops.

---

### 🔹 3. Array Left Rotation  
📁 File: [ArrayLeftRotation.java](./ArrayLeftRotation.java)  
🔁 Left rotate an array `k` times with correct shifting logic.

---

## 🏁 Concepts Covered:
- HashMap & LinkedHashMap
- `getOrDefault()` method
- Nested loops
- Array rotation logic
- Java basics + Scanner usage
